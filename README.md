This model is for educational purposes ONLY! Nehr and I have decided to release this to the public for educational purposes, it has proxies and such for sea chests etc, but this is and was a WIP model, you may encounter issues. All bugs that are known will be listed below, if you manage fix them please do share :) NO SUPPORT WILL BE GIVEN ON THIS MODEL, If you need any help there is many discords out there, I personally would recommend DayZ Modders discord (link below)

You may only re-use the scripts/configs within this, model/textures you may not reupload/use in any public releases.
